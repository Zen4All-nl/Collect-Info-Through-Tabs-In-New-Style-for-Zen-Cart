## Attention
This module is still under development. Currently we are at version [2.0.0 beta 9](https://github.com/Zen4All-nl/Collect-Info-Through-Tabs-In-New-Style-for-Zen-Cart/releases/tag/2.0.0-beta.9).

The latest stable version is 1.0.2 found [here](https://github.com/Zen4All-nl/Collect-Info-Through-Tabs-In-New-Style-for-Zen-Cart/releases/latest).

## Information
The current collect info page can be quite long, and is not very user friendly. Therefore I started searching for a better solution.

After looking at many other shopping cart frameworks, I got a pretty good idea of how I wanted the new collect info page to look.
It became a page with tabs for different categories of information. The default tabs are:
 - General
 - Data
 - Manufacturer
 - Image
 - Metatags

This is the information that is currently available by default on the product collect info pages.

New tabs can easily be added. I added a few available in the "Extra_tabs" folder.
These are:
 - attributes
 - category
 - information
 - quantity discounts

Copy these folders to your server, and Cittins will pick them up, and display them.

Additional information can be found in the documentation folder.

## Features
There are many new features added to the Zen Cart functionality. Below I mentioned some per page.

### Category and Product Listing
 - Improved page layout and styling
 - Easy sorting by using the arrows in the table heading
 - Set which columns you want to see on screen
 - Added buttons to navigate up on folder, or go to the top level
 - Checkboxes to delete move or copy multiple categories or products at once.
### Category edit
 - Tabs are added to split the shown data into smaller blocks
 - After saving you stay on the edit page. This makes storing you edits easier on long edit sessions
