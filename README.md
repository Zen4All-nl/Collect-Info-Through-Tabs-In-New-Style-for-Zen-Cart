# Zen Cart Collect Info Through Tabs In New Style (CITTINS)

The current collect info page can be quit long, and is not very user friendly. Therefore I started searching for a better solution.

After looking at many other shopping cart frameworks, I have a pretty good idea of how I want the new  collect info page to look.
It will be a page with tabs for different categories of information. The default tabs are:
 - General
 - Data
 - Links
 - Images
 - Category
 
This is the information that is currently available by default on the product collect info pages, with one exception, I added the metatags to the collect page.

This will be the the initial release.

In future releases I plan on adding extra info, by using drop in mudules. This way others can contribute by writing their own tabs, that will be included by dropping the files in a specific folder (for example: admin/includes/modules/producttabs).
Extra tabs that are planned are:
 - Product Attributes
 - Discounts / specials / featured (maybe one tab or multiple)
 - Product history
 - Product reports (Views, purchases, etc.)
 
Also I a want to add ajax to add thing like (additional) images dynamically.
