# Zen Cart Collect Info Through Tabs In New Style (CITTINS)

The current collect info page can be quite long, especially when having multiple languages, , and is not very user friendly. Therefore I started searching for a better solution.

After looking at many other shopping cart frameworks, I have a pretty good idea of how I want the new  collect info page to look.
It will be a page with tabs for different categories of information. The default tabs are:
 - General
 - Data
 - Manufacturer
 - Image
 
This is the information that is currently available by default on the product collect info pages, with one exception, I added the meta tags to the collect page.

Additional information can be found in the documentation folder.
